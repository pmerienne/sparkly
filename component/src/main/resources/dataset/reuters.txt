Pos-acq,2 AMERICAN EXPRESS ltAXP VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS     By Patti Domm  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 2 - American Express Co  rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc  said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearons access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition     In a joint statement  American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters     American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place     Last week  rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public     There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson  but the plan was considered highly unlikely  analysts said      American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday  as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-12 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74      It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees     Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage  which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year     Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm      Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express 125 billion dlr net in 1986     American Express ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 35 billion dlrs     To some however  the need for added capital is puzzling American Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to  said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities     Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added  previously vacant  post of president      The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearsons operating divisions  a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company      Analysts  contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last weeks market speculation It does confirm  however  that the financial services firm  which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year  is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition     Late last year  Shearsons takeover offer to the EF Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton  and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage          Reuter 3

Pos-coffee,2 COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS     By Douglas Learmond  Reuters     LONDON  March 3 - Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas  ICO delegates and traders said     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization  ICO  producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-12 year low at one stage of 1 270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1 314 stg  down 184 stg from the previous close     The New York May price was down 1559 at 10800 cents a lb     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices  some senior traders said     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 11466 cents a lb for March 2 This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop     In a Reuter interview  Brazilian Coffee Institute  IBC  President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions If we have failed at the ICO  at least we have tried  Dauster said  adding now it is time to go and sell coffee     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month  Dauster said It is too difficult to forecast now Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 112 mln Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on Londons futures market last year     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market in one go but is sold over a minimum of six months     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas Consumers said objective criteria like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares  Dauster said     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the ad hoc way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings     It is a simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate policy to other producers While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different objective criteria achieve different share-outs of quota  Dauster said     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them     We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage  one delegate said     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine In that case quotas could come into force during the summer But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely  while Brazils Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found     Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now  one consumer said  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 AFTER G-6  ROUND ONE GOES TO CENTRAL BANKS     By Claire Miller  Reuters     NEW YORK  March 13 - Central banks have easily beaten back the foreign exchange markets first test of the industrialized nations recent pact to stabilize currencies  analysts said     In active trading this week  the market pushed the dollar  sterling  the Canadian dollar and Australian dollar higher But operators got their fingers burned as one by one the central banks signalled their displeasure     So far G-6 has been a roaring success said James ONeill  financial markets economist at Marine Midland Bank NA     The central banks are sending strong signals that they wont tolerate any kind of momentum building behind currencies  added a senior corporate trader at one UK bank     On February 22  the finance ministers and central bank governors of the US  Japan  West Germany  France and the UK -- the Group of Five -- plus Canada  signed an accord under which they agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around prevailing levels     The agreement was viewed by many in the market as an attempt to put a floor under the dollar after its sizeable two-year decline against major world currencies     And initially  traders indicated their respect for the accord by refraining from pushing the dollar lower     But by Wednesday  the dollar climbed to more than 187 marks  about five pfennigs above its levels the Friday before the G-6 accord     The move was aided by indications that the US economy picked up steam in February at the same time as the West German economy was regressing     But dealers said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York gave traders a sharp reminder that the G-6 pact had encompassed the idea of limiting inordinate dollar gains as well as declines     Dealers differed as to whether the US central bank actually intervened to sell dollars above 187 marks  or simply telephoned dealers to ask for quotes and enquire about trading conditions     But the dollar quickly backed off It hovered today around 185 marks The market was surprised that the Fed showed its face so soon  said Marine Midland NAs ONeill     Also on Wednesday  London dealers said the Bank of England intervened in the open market to sell sterling as the UK currency rose to 160 dlrs compared with 15355 dlrs before the G-6 pact     Sterling  along with the other high-yield currencies like the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar  was in favor after traders surmised that the the chance of intervention pursuant to the Paris currency accord left limited room for profit plays on dollarmark and dollaryen     The pound also was boosted by suggestions of an improving UK economy  anticipation of a popular British budget on March 17 and public opinion polls showing good chances for the incumbent Conservative party in any general election     There was a real run on sterling  said Anne Mills of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc     Sterling traded today around 15750 dlrs  down from 15870 dlrs last night It slid to 2917 marks from 2950 yesterday and from a peak of about 298 recently Theres been some heavy profit-taking on sterlingmark ahead of next Tuesdays UK budget  said James McGroarty of Discount Corp     As speculators detected the presence of the US and British central banks  they acclerated their shift into Canadian and Australian dollars But here too they were stymied The Bank of Canada acted to slow its currencys rise     The Canadian dollar traded at 1321823 per US dollar today  down from 1318590 yesterday     And the Australian Reserve Bank  using the Fed as agent  sold Australian dollars in the US yesterday  dealers said     The Australian dollar fell to a low of 674555 US cents today from a high of 6902 Thursday     Analysts said the central banks moves to stifle sudden upward movement  leave the market uncertain about its next step Today  the focus shifted to the yen which has held to a very tight range against the dollar for several months     The dollar fell to 1523540 yen from 1533540 last night Analysts said the yen also gained as traders unwound long sterlingshort mark positions established lately     Because of the change in perceptions about the health of the German economy  the funds from those unwinding operations are ending up in yen  a dealer at one UK bank said     Recent West German data have shown falling industry orders  lower industrial output and slowing employment gains     Moreover  the yen is benefitting as Japanese entities who have invested heavily overseas  for example in Australian financial instruments  repatriate their profits ahead of the end of the Japanese fiscal year on March 31     Noting that the dollaryen rate is in a sense the most controversial one because of the large US trade deficit with Japan  analysts said the stage could be set for another test of the dollars downward scope against the Japanese currency     In its latest review of the foreign exchange market through the end of January  the Federal Reserve revealed that it intervened to protect the dollar against the yen on January 28 On that day  the dollar fell as low as 15040 yen     Sure  the Fed bought dollars near the 150 yen level in January But the market has to bear in mind that time marches on and the situation changes  said McGroarty of Discount  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 FED CHAIRMAN VOLCKER SAYS BANK PROPOSALS A WORRY     WASHINGTON  March 24 - The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board  Paul Volcker  has written to the chairman of the House Banking Committee to raise concerns about legislative proposals scheduled for consideration Wednesday     Volcker told committee chairman Fernand St Germain a proposal to deny primary dealer status to firms from countries that do not grant US firms equal access to their government debt markets might invite retaliation against US firms abroad     He added  even Japan  against whom this proposal seems to be particularly directed  has started opening its markets     In his letter  made available at the Treasury  Volcker also said a proposal to ease debt problems of developing countries by setting up a public facility to buy their debts owed to commercial banks  was a problem     I believe that the prospect of debt relief would undermine the difficult internal efforts of the borrowing countries to achieve the structural reform that is needed regardless of the policies that are followed on servicing external debt  Volcker said     It might also cause private lenders to become reluctant to extend more credit to the borrowing countries  he said     Volcker said he endorsed comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker about the inappropriateness of using public resources for purchasing private commercial bank debt  which we both see as an inherent aspect of the proposed international debt facility     He also said a proposal for establishing formal procedures for international negotiations on currency exchange rates is unrealistic and could well have damaging effects     For example  the bills directive to intitiate negotiations in order to achieve a competitive exchange rate for the dollar -- a matter upon which there can be considerable difference among analysts -- runs the risk of building up potentially destabilizing market expectations  Volcker said     He recommended we should not lock ourselves into formalized procedures for international negotiations on exchange rates but instead use other  more flexible means like the recent mmeting in Paris between US treasury and central bank representatives and those of major trade allies  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 MIDDLE EAST CURRENCY MARKET SEES KEY CHANGES     By Stephen Jukes  Reuters     BAHRAIN  March 25 - Middle East currency dealers meet in Abu Dhabi this weekend at a time of fundamental change in their business  which has seen a growing volume of trade shift from the Arab world to London     The 14th congress of the Inter-Arab Cambiste Association also comes at a time when the prospect of a unified Gulf currency system is more real that at any time this decade     Foreign exchange traders and bank treasurers said these issues  and the slide of the Lebanese pound  can be expected to be major talking points     About 250 traders and treasurers from some 115 banks -- including some in London and other major non-Arab financial centres -- are expected to attend the conference which begins on on Saturday     Bankers said it is hard to avoid the impression that a growing proportion of transactions in the Saudi riyal market  by far the largest in the region  is being carried out in London     The market had been dominated by Saudi Arabias 11 banks  foreign exchange houses in the Kingdom and offshore banks in Bahrain But bankers said more and more Saudi and Bahrain-based banks are boosting their treasury operations in London     As recession hit the Middle East and the need for trade finance in the region declined  many offshore banks in Bahrain ran down their currency operations None of the four major UK Clearing banks now has a dealing room on the island     The two major Bahrain-based international banks  ltArab Banking Corp and ltGulf International Bank BSC have increased their presence in London and Saudi banks are busy upgrading representative offices to branch status to allow dealing     One economist said It is cheaper to run a riyal book in London than staff an expensive offshore operation in Bahrain There is now the nucleus of a two-way market in London     Jeddah-based ltRiyad Bank set up as a licensed deposit taker in London in 1984  while its main rival in Saudi Arabia  ltNational Commercial Bank NCB won a licence in November 1986     The major market maker has traditionally been London-based consortium bank ltSaudi International Bank but the kingdom joint-venture ltSaudi American Bank SAMBA also upgraded its London operation to deposit taker status in mid-February     One senior currency trader in Riyadh said Inevitably the volume of business in London has gained pace with the two new licences for NCB and SAMBA  but there is no question that most of the liquidity still rests in Saudi Arabia     Currency traders said the shift to London in the Saudi riyal market is difficult to quantify     Bahrain Monetary Agency figures show regional currency deposits held by offshore banks  most in Saudi riyals  dropped to the equivalent of 122 billion dlrs at end-September 1986 from 134 billion at end-1985 and a 1983 peak of 150 billion     The shift has prompted changes in dealing habits Riyal trading in the Gulf on Saturdays and Sundays has become very quiet with London closed while some Saudi and Bahrain banks now staff offices on Friday  the Gulf weekend Traders also expect ltArab National Bank to step up London operations     Traders say it is difficult to foresee the riyal market moving completely out of the region  partly because of local demand and partly because of what is seen as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agencys SAMA desire to moderate internationalisation of the riyal and protect it from undue speculation     There have been far fewer signs of the Kuwaiti dinar market shifting from its natural base of Kuwait and trading in Bahrain and London is still limited     But for the first time since the formation of the six nation Gulf Cooperation Council GCC in 1981 there are signs that a much mooted currency union could come into force soon     Currency traders said it remains unclear what form a final currency union would take for the six states -- Saudi Arabia  Kuwait  Bahrain  Oman  Qatar and the United Arab Emirates     But plans to link the six currencies in a European Monetary System style with a common peg have been discussed at high level and could be a topic on the GCCs annual summit expected to be held in Saudi Arabia late in the year     One dealer said A lot of exposure is being given to discussions and plans appear to be quite advanced But in the end a political decision has to be taken to give the go-ahead     One open question is that of a common peg for currencies     The idea of linking the six currencies has been debated since the start of the GCC The Kuwaiti dinar is currently linked to a basket of currencies while the other five currencies are either officially or in practice linked to the US Dollar     Some traders said a currency union could mean speculation against the Saudi riyal rubbing off on other Gulf currencies  but plans call for a permitted divergence in the system of 7-14 pct  large enough to avoid sudden strains     Another topic for debate is expected to be the continued slide of the Lebanese pound against the dollar and the undermining of the effective capital base of Lebanese banks  REUTER 3

Pos-money-fx,2 US FED EXPLORES COMMODITY BASKET INDEX     By Alver Carlson  Reuters     WASHINGTON  MARCH 31 - The complex task of wielding control over monetary policy in an increasingly fast-moving global economy could be aided by tying policy to commodity prices  the newest member of the Federal Reserve Board says     Commodity prices are already considered by the Fed in the making of monetary policy But they would be given a much greater role under an idea being floated by Governor Robert Heller  who joined the board last August     He conceeds that much more study of the idea is needed  but argues that such an arrangement  particularly if it were adopted by other major industrial countries  could reduce the volatility of exchange rates     Moreover  it could help stabilize of the prices of commodities themselves  slowing changes in inflation     His idea  which many conservative economists find appealing  has some backing among board members appointed in recent years by President Reagan     It would complement the present system of opening or closing the monetary screws based on the pattern of inflation  key indicators such as unemployment  and the rise or fall of the money supply Changes in the money supply can lead to changes in interest rates and affect economic activity directly     Discussed on and off for a long time  the commodity concept is part of a growing search for a system that anchors monetary policy and widely-fluxtuating currency prices to a more solid base     What is needed is an anchor or reference point that can serve as a guide for both domestic and international monetary purposes  says Heller     In the past  this anchor was gold but the United States went off the gold standard because the global economy had vastly outstripped gold supplies     A return to the gold standard is generally dismissed out of hand by most policymakers on the grounds that the largest producers of gold are the Soviet Union and South Africa     The so-called fixed rate system  scuttled in the early 1970s  is still considered unworkable in the present world     But the current system of floating currencies in which currencies can fluxtuate widely  adding vast pressures to the monetary system  is also being widely questioned     Some have suggested that the system might benefit from a formal approach that mandates intervention by countries when currencies wander above or below agreed to levels but there are major problems with this also     For one thing  there is justifiable concern that countries might be relunctant to intervene if they felt it might be detrimental to their own domestic economy     Moreover  some question whether concerted intervention can make much of an inpact if the overall market does not agree with the fundamental judgement     The poorest countries have called for a monetary conference to work out a new system that  not surprisingly  helps them cope with their overpowering debt problems     Treasury Secretary James Baker  the Reagan administrations chief economic architect  has preferred to use the so-called Group of Five industrial countries or sometimes  Seven  as a forum to work out cooperative agreements on currency and other economic matters    He appears convinced that officials from West Germany  France  Britain  Japan  Italy and Canada talking quietly behind closed doors can reached reasoned decisions away from public posturing    The Heller approach  while extremely complex  could have a profound impact on the system  ideally stabalizing prices and international exchange rates     As envisioned by Heller  a basket of say  30 major commodities ranging from wheat to oil  would be put together and prices would be measured on a regular basis     In times of rising commodity prices  monetary policy might be tightened and in times of falling commodity prices  montary policy might be eased  he says     He notes that commodity prices are traded daily in auction markets  and a commodity price index can be calculated on a virtually continuous basis     Moreover  most commodity prices are produced  consumed and traded on a world-wide basis  so that an index has a relevance for the entire world  he says     In addition  commodity prices are at the beginning of the production chain and serve as an imput into virtually all production processes     Focusing on commodity prices as an early and sensitive indicator of current and perhaps also future prices pressures  the monetary authorities may take such an index into account in making their monetary policy decisions  he says     However  he says that any major change in a basic commodity such as occurred in oil during the 1970s because of action by the OPEC cartel  would have to be discounted in such a system     He says the worst thing that could happen is to allow monetary policy to spread a freakish increase in one commodity to the rest of the system and to other commodities  Reuter 3

Pos-money-fx,2 US CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING     By Martin Cherrin  Reuters     NEW YORK  April 6 - US Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar  the economy and Federal Reserve policy  economists said     Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains  that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady  perhaps for several months     Until trends are clearer  the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates  said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets     Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate  the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in US Dollartrade policy     Salomon Brothers Henry Kaufman said the bond market  highly sensitized to dollar movements  could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if US And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply     The crucial question  however  is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur  Kaufman said     Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer  said Philip Braverman  chief economist at Irving Securities Corp     However  Braverman said that  from a longer term perspective  current bond prices provide a buying opportunity     Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data  key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-14 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursdays 793 pct closing yield was a 1987 high     Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 793 pct area provides a basis for optimism Bonds closed at 786 pct on Friday     The Irving economist noted that three times last year  in a similar paroxysm of pessimism  the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high Within three to six weeks in each instance  however  Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points     Mitchell Held of Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear  which he considers unlikely     Held said that  since late 1986  Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months     Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear Naturally  that would mean a sharp bond price fall     Yields could rise further over the next few months  but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise weve seen since the start of the year  Held said     Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term     The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance  said economists at Aubrey G Lanston and Co Inc     They said the Fed cannot tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology That might harm the fragile US Economic expansion     The Lanston economists said  The Fed cannot ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar     Minutes of Februarys Federal Open Market Committee FOMC meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy  foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift     However  economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish US Economic growth and the financial strains on US Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming     There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesdays meeting also left Fed policy unchanged     This weeks US Economic data are expected to have little impact February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday  with March producer price data out Friday     There may be mild relief in some quarters that the US Purchasing Managers Composite Index  a closely-watched economic indicator  rose only to 539 pct in March from 519 pct A Friday rumor had put the number far higher The indexs first quarter average also was 539 pct  translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987     Federal funds traded at 5-1516 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen  REUTER 3
